;;; Description
;;; 
;;; GObject is the fundamental type providing the common attributes and methods
;;; for all object types in GTK+, Pango and other libraries based on GObject.
;;; The GObject class provides methods for object construction and destruction,
;;; property access methods, and signal support. Signals are described in detail
;;; in Signals(3).
;;; 
;;; GInitiallyUnowned is derived from GObject. The only difference between the
;;; two is that the initial reference of a GInitiallyUnowned is flagged as a
;;; floating reference. This means that it is not specifically claimed to be
;;; "owned" by any code portion. The main motivation for providing floating
;;; references is C convenience. In particular, it allows code to be written as:
;;; 
;;;  1 container = create_container ();
;;;  2 container_add_child (container, create_child());
;;; 
;;; If container_add_child() will g_object_ref_sink() the passed in child, no
;;; reference of the newly created child is leaked. Without floating references,
;;; container_add_child() can only g_object_ref() the new child, so to implement
;;; this code without reference leaks, it would have to be written as:
;;; 
;;;  1 Child *child;
;;;  2 container = create_container ();
;;;  3 child = create_child ();
;;;  4 container_add_child (container, child);
;;;  5 g_object_unref (child);
;;; 
;;; The floating reference can be converted into an ordinary reference by
;;; calling g_object_ref_sink(). For already sunken objects (objects that don't
;;; have a floating reference anymore), g_object_ref_sink() is equivalent to
;;; g_object_ref() and returns a new reference. Since floating references are
;;; useful almost exclusively for C convenience, language bindings that provide
;;; automated reference and memory ownership maintenance (such as smart pointers
;;; or garbage collection) should not expose floating references in their API.
;;; 
;;; Some object implementations may need to save an objects floating state
;;; across certain code portions (an example is GtkMenu), to achieve this, the
;;; following sequence can be used:
;;; 
;;;  1 /* save floating state */
;;;  2 gboolean was_floating = g_object_is_floating (object);
;;;  3 g_object_ref_sink (object);
;;;  4 /* protected code portion */
;;;  5 ...;
;;;  6 /* restore floating state */
;;;  7 if (was_floating)
;;;  8   g_object_force_floating (object);
;;;  9 g_object_unref (object); /* release previously acquired reference */

;;;     the constructed function is called by g_object_new() as the final step
