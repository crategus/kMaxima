;;; Implemented Interfaces
;;; 
;;; GtkVBox implements AtkImplementorIface, GtkBuildable and GtkOrientable.
;;; Description
;;; 
;;; A GtkVBox is a container that organizes child widgets into a single column.
;;; 
;;; Use the GtkBox packing interface to determine the arrangement, spacing,
;;; height, and alignment of GtkVBox children.
;;; 
;;; All children are allocated the same width.
;;; 
;;; GtkVBox has been deprecated. You can use GtkBox instead, which is a very
;;; quick and easy change. If you have derived your own classes from GtkVBox,
;;; you can simply change the inheritance to derive directly from GtkBox, and
;;; set the "orientation" property to GTK_ORIENTATION_VERTICAL in your instance
;;; init function, with a call like:
;;; 
;;;  1 gtk_orientable_set_orientation (GTK_ORIENTABLE (object),
;;;  2                                 GTK_ORIENTATION_VERTICAL);
;;; 
;;; If you want your code to be future-proof, the recommendation is to switch to
;;; GtkGrid, since GtkBox is going to be deprecated in favor of the more
;;; flexible grid widget eventually. For more information about migrating to
;;; GtkGrid, see Migrating from other containers to GtkGrid.
