;;; Description
;;; 
;;; A GdkWindow is a rectangular region on the screen. It's a low-level object,
;;; used to implement high-level objects such as GtkWidget and GtkWindow on the
;;; GTK+ level. A GtkWindow is a toplevel window, the thing a user might think
;;; of as a "window" with a titlebar and so on; a GtkWindow may contain many
;;; GdkWindow. For example, each GtkButton has a GdkWindow associated with it.
;;;
;;; Composited Windows
;;; 
;;; Normally, the windowing system takes care of rendering the contents of a
;;; child window onto its parent window. This mechanism can be intercepted by
;;; calling gdk_window_set_composited() on the child window. For a composited
;;; window it is the responsibility of the application to render the window
;;; contents at the right spot.

;;; In the example Example 7, “Composited windows”, a button is placed inside
;;; of an event box inside of a window. The event box is set as composited and
;;; therefore is no longer automatically drawn to the screen.
;;; 
;;; When the contents of the event box change, an expose event is generated on
;;; its parent window (which, in this case, belongs to the toplevel GtkWindow).
;;; The expose handler for this widget is responsible for merging the changes
;;; back on the screen in the way that it wishes.
;;; 
;;; In our case, we merge the contents with a 50% transparency. We also set the
;;; background colour of the window to red. The effect is that the background
;;; shows through the button.
;;;
;;; Offscreen Windows
;;; 
;;; Offscreen windows are more general than composited windows, since they
;;; allow not only to modify the rendering of the child window onto its parent,
;;; but also to apply coordinate transformations.
;;; 
;;; To integrate an offscreen window into a window hierarchy, one has to call
;;; gdk_offscreen_window_set_embedder() and handle a number of signals. The
;;; "pick-embedded-child" signal on the embedder window is used to select an
;;; offscreen child at given coordinates, and the "to-embedder" and
;;; "from-embedder" signals on the offscreen window are used to translate
;;; coordinates between the embedder and the offscreen window.
;;; 
;;; For rendering an offscreen window onto its embedder, the contents of the
;;; offscreen window are available as a pixmap, via
;;; gdk_offscreen_window_get_pixmap().

;;; The GdkGeometry struct gives the window manager information about a window's geometry constraints. Normally you would set these on the GTK+ level using gtk_window_set_geometry_hints(). GtkWindow then sets the hints on the GdkWindow it creates.
;;; 
;;; gdk_window_set_geometry_hints() expects the hints to be fully valid already and simply passes them to the window manager; in contrast, gtk_window_set_geometry_hints() performs some interpretation. For example, GtkWindow will apply the hints to the geometry widget instead of the toplevel window, if you set a geometry widget. Also, the min_width/min_height/max_width/max_height fields may be set to -1, and GtkWindow will substitute the size request of the window or geometry widget. If the minimum size hint is not provided, GtkWindow will use its requisition as the minimum size. If the minimum size is provided and a geometry widget is set, GtkWindow will take the minimum size as the minimum size of the geometry widget rather than the entire window. The base size is treated similarly.
;;; 
;;; The canonical use-case for gtk_window_set_geometry_hints() is to get a terminal widget to resize properly. Here, the terminal text area should be the geometry widget; GtkWindow will then automatically set the base size to the size of other widgets in the terminal window, such as the menubar and scrollbar. Then, the width_inc and height_inc fields should be set to the size of one character in the terminal. Finally, the base size should be set to the size of one character. The net effect is that the minimum size of the terminal will have a 1x1 character terminal area, and only terminal sizes on the "character grid" will be allowed.
;;; 
;;; Here's an example of how the terminal example would be implemented, assuming a terminal area widget called "terminal" and a toplevel window "toplevel":

;;; Indicates that you are beginning the process of redrawing region. A backing store (offscreen buffer) large enough to contain region will be created. The backing store will be initialized with the background color or background pixmap for window. Then, all drawing operations performed on window will be diverted to the backing store. When you call gdk_window_end_paint(), the backing store will be copied to window, making it visible onscreen. Only the part of window contained in region will be modified; that is, drawing operations are clipped to region.
;;; 
;;; The net result of all this is to remove flicker, because the user sees the finished product appear all at once when you call gdk_window_end_paint(). If you draw to window directly without calling gdk_window_begin_paint_region(), the user may see flicker as individual drawing operations are performed in sequence. The clipping and background-initializing features of gdk_window_begin_paint_region() are conveniences for the programmer, so you can avoid doing that work yourself.
;;; 
;;; When using GTK+, the widget system automatically places calls to gdk_window_begin_paint_region() and gdk_window_end_paint() around emissions of the expose_event signal. That is, if you're writing an expose event handler, you can assume that the exposed area in GdkEventExpose has already been cleared to the window background, is already set as the clip region, and already has a backing store. Therefore in most cases, application code need not call gdk_window_begin_paint_region(). (You can disable the automatic calls around expose events on a widget-by-widget basis by calling gtk_widget_set_double_buffered().)
;;; 
;;; If you call this function multiple times before calling the matching gdk_window_end_paint(), the backing stores are pushed onto a stack. gdk_window_end_paint() copies the topmost backing store onscreen, subtracts the topmost region from all other regions in the stack, and pops the stack. All drawing operations affect only the topmost backing store in the stack. One matching call to gdk_window_end_paint() is required for each call to gdk_window_begin_paint_region().
